# Line-Following-Robot

For my grade 11 Computer Engineering final project, I made a model of a four way intersection that is controlled with a PIC 24FV32KA microcontroller. There are four traffic lights and a stepper motor for a railroad crossing gate. The lights flash yellow in the direction of pedestrian crossing. If the crossing button is pressed, the stepper motor lowers the gate and the lights flash red . There is also flashing green lights if the advanced green button is pressed. There are four folders in this repository. Each is a program for a different line following challenge.
